#  Types of Design Patterns:

1. Creational Patterns:
   These patterns deal with object creation and initialization. 
   Examples include: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder

2. Structural Patterns:
    These patterns address how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. 
    Examples include: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite

3. Behavioral Patterns:
    These patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate. 
    Examples include: Observer, Strategy, State, Template Method, Chain of Responsibility.
