Scene: Office or video call — Job interview for a PHP developer role

    Interviewer (INT)

    PHP Engineer (ENG)

INT: Good morning! Thanks for joining us today. How are you?

ENG: Good morning! I'm doing great, thank you. Excited to be here.

INT: Awesome. Let’s get started. Could you briefly introduce yourself and your experience with PHP?

ENG: Sure. I've been working as a PHP developer for around five years. I started with basic CMS customization like WordPress, then moved on to building custom web apps using Laravel and Symfony. My current focus is backend API development and performance optimization.

INT: Sounds solid. How comfortable are you with object-oriented PHP?

ENG: Very comfortable. I follow OOP principles in all my projects — using classes, interfaces, traits, dependency injection, and so on. I also use design patterns where applicable, like Singleton, Factory, and Repository.

INT: Great. Here's a scenario: You have a Laravel project, and you notice the response time is unusually slow. What steps would you take to debug and improve performance?

ENG: First, I’d use Laravel’s built-in debugging tools like Telescope or debugbar to identify bottlenecks — maybe slow queries or unnecessary loops. I’d also look at database query logs and consider using eager loading to reduce N+1 queries. If needed, I’d implement caching using Redis or optimize the database indexes.

INT: That's exactly what I was hoping to hear. Quick question: What’s the difference between include, require, include_once, and require_once in PHP?

ENG: Sure.

    include and require both bring in a file, but require will throw a fatal error if the file is not found, while include just gives a warning.

    include_once and require_once are similar, but they make sure the file is included only once — useful for preventing redeclaration errors.

INT: Spot on. How about handling security in PHP — what are some common practices you follow?

ENG: I always sanitize user input, use prepared statements with PDO for SQL queries, and implement CSRF protection. I also handle proper error reporting — logging errors but not displaying them to users in production. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, and I stay updated with security advisories for any libraries I use.

INT: Excellent. One last thing — have you worked with APIs? REST or GraphQL?

ENG: Yes, I’ve built and consumed RESTful APIs extensively. Mostly in Laravel using resources and API routes. I've also played around with GraphQL, though I’ve worked more with REST in production.

INT: Good to know. Alright, that’s most of the technical part. Do you have any questions for me?

ENG: Yes, could you tell me more about the tech stack and the team I’d be working with?

INT: Absolutely — we use Laravel for the backend, Vue.js on the frontend, and Docker for deployment. The team is small but experienced, and we follow agile sprints with daily standups.

ENG: Sounds like a great setup.

INT: Alright, thanks for your time! We’ll be in touch soon.

ENG: Thank you! I appreciate the opportunity.
