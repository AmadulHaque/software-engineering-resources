Introduction & Small Talk

Interviewer: Hi, [Candidate's Name]! Thanks for coming in today. How’s your day going so far?

Candidate: It’s going well, thanks! I’ve been looking forward to this opportunity.

Interviewer: Great to hear! Let’s jump right in. Could you walk me through your experience with PHP and web development?


Technical Experience & Background

Candidate: Sure! I’ve been working with PHP for about [X] years, mostly in backend development. I’ve built RESTful APIs, integrated with databases like MySQL, and worked with frameworks like Laravel and Symfony.

Interviewer: Nice! Can you tell me about a recent project where you used PHP?

Candidate: Absolutely. At my last job, I developed a payment processing module using Laravel. It handled transactions, logging, and webhook integrations with third-party services like Stripe.


Core PHP Questions

Interviewer: Let’s dive into some technical questions. How do you handle SQL injection in PHP?

Candidate: I always use prepared statements with PDO or MySQLi. For example:
php
Copy

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email");  
    $stmt->execute(['email' => $userInput]);  

This ensures user input is safely escaped.

Interviewer: Good. What about PHP’s type system? How do you enforce strict typing?

Candidate: I use declare(strict_types=1); at the top of files to enforce strict type checks. I also leverage return type declarations like function getUser(): array {} to make code more predictable.
Framework-Specific Questions (Laravel Example)

Interviewer: Since you’ve used Laravel, how would you handle user authentication?

Candidate: Laravel’s built-in Auth scaffolding makes it easy. I’d use:
bash
Copy

php artisan make:auth  

For APIs, I’d use Sanctum or Passport for token-based auth.

Interviewer: What’s the difference between where() and whereIn() in Eloquent?

Candidate: where() checks a single condition (WHERE column = value), while whereIn() checks if a column’s value exists in an array (WHERE column IN (1, 2, 3)).
Problem-Solving & Debugging

Interviewer: Suppose a PHP script is running slowly. How would you debug it?

Candidate: First, I’d check slow queries with Laravel’s query log or tools like Clockwork. Then, I’d profile with Xdebug or Blackfire to find bottlenecks—maybe an N+1 query issue or inefficient loops.

Interviewer: What if you encounter a "memory exhausted" error?

Candidate: I’d increase memory_limit in php.ini temporarily, but I’d also check for memory leaks—like unset large variables or unbounded dataset processing.
Follow-Up & Soft Skills

Interviewer: How do you stay updated with PHP changes?

Candidate: I follow PHP’s RFCs, read blogs like Laravel News, and experiment with new features like PHP 8’s attributes and fibers.

Interviewer: Describe a time you had a disagreement with a teammate on a technical approach.

Candidate: Once, a colleague wanted to use raw SQL for a complex report, but I advocated for Eloquent for maintainability. We compromised by using a hybrid approach—Eloquent for most queries and raw SQL only for the most optimized parts.
Closing & Next Steps

Interviewer: Great discussion! Do you have any questions for me?

Candidate: Yes—what’s the biggest technical challenge your team is facing right now?

Interviewer: We’re migrating a legacy PHP 5 app to PHP 8, so experience with upgrades would be valuable.

Candidate: That’s interesting—I’ve done similar migrations before. I’d love to help!

Interviewer: Perfect! We’ll be in touch soon. Thanks again for your time.
